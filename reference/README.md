# TheekKaro üèôÔ∏è

*Because our cities deserve better, and every citizen should have a voice.*

## What is TheekKaro?

TheekKaro is an iOS app that makes reporting civic issues as easy as taking a photo. Spotted a pothole? Broken streetlight? Just snap, tag, and it's documented with GPS precision. 

I built this because I was tired of walking past the same broken things every day, feeling helpless about it. Now anyone can be part of fixing their neighborhood.

## The Vision

Imagine if reporting a civic issue took just 30 seconds. Imagine if every citizen could contribute to making their city better with just their phone. That's TheekKaro.

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ **Working iOS app** with map, camera, and local storage

## What It Does Right Now

- **üìç Interactive Map**: See all reported issues on a beautiful map with color-coded categories
- **üì∏ Quick Reporting**: Tap the + button, snap a photo, pick a category (pothole, streetlight, garbage, water leak, other)
- **üóÇÔ∏è Smart Organization**: Everything is categorized and stored locally on your device
- **üîí Privacy First**: No servers, no accounts, your data stays on your phone

## What's Coming Next 1.0.21 üé®

I just finished designing a gorgeous 6-step reporting flow in Figma that transforms the basic form into something beautiful:

1. **Smart Start** - Better way to begin reporting
2. **Photo Magic** - Enhanced camera experience  
3. **Easy Tagging** - Beautiful category selection
4. **Story Time** - Guided description input
5. **Review & Polish** - See before you submit
6. **Victory Lap** - Celebrate contribution + sharing as a message

The designs are ready, now it's time to build this delightful experience.

## Why This Matters

Every pothole reported is a step toward better roads. Every broken streetlight documented is a push for safer streets. This isn't just an app‚Äîit's a way for regular people to have an impact on their community.

## Tech Stack

- **iOS 17+** with SwiftUI
- **MapKit** for beautiful maps
- **Local storage** for privacy
- **No external dependencies** - pure iOS

## Design System Colors üé®

Based on the Figma design system, here are the core colors for TheekKaro:

- **Warm Cream**: `#F9F3D1` - Accent backgrounds, highlights
- **Sage Green**: `#6B7A47` - Secondary actions, nature elements

These colors create a warm, approachable feel that makes civic engagement feel welcoming rather than bureaucratic.
