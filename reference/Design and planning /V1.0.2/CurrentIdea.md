# TheekKaro v1.0.2 - Enhanced Add Pin Flow

## **What You Want to Do**

You want to **replace the basic add issue form** with a **beautiful multi-step flow** that matches your new UI designs. Instead of the current simple form, users will go through a guided step-by-step process that feels polished and professional.

## **The New Add Pin Flow (Based on Your UI Designs)**

Your designs show a **6-step process**:
1. **Popover/Modal Start** - User taps FAB and sees initial form
2. **Photo Capture** - Add photos with better UI
3. **Tag Selection** - Choose categories with improved design  
4. **Description** - Add details with better input fields
5. **Form Complete** - Review before submitting
6. **Success/Share** - Confirmation and sharing options

## **Key Improvements You're Making**

- **Multi-step form** instead of single screen
- **Better visual design** with proper spacing, typography, and colors
- **Reusable design components** that you can use throughout the app
- **Improved user experience** with guided flow
- **Modern UI elements** following your design system

## **Next Steps to Take**

1. **Create Design System Components** - Build reusable buttons, cards, input fields, and other UI elements

2. **Build New Form Components** - Replace the current `ReportSheetView.swift` with new multi-step components

3. **Implement Step-by-Step Flow** - Create navigation between the 6 steps shown in your designs

4. **Update the FAB Interaction** - Modify how the add button works to trigger the new flow

5. **Style According to Designs** - Apply your specific colors, spacing, and visual elements

**Simple Goal**: Transform the basic "take photo → pick category → add description → save" into a beautiful, guided multi-step experience that matches your UI designs while building reusable components for future features.
